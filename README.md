# TS-LLM-Fusion

This project explores how large language-models and transformer architectures can be adapted for time-series reasoning, temporal understanding, and forecasting.

This project is inspired by two recent works:

[OpenTSLM: Time-Series Language Models for Reasoning Over Multivariate Medical Text-and-Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02410)

[LLM-PS: Empowering Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Patterns and Semantics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09656)

Our goal is to understand, implement, and experiment with ideas from these papers, and to build a small prototype model or pipeline that combines:

- LLM-style semantic understanding
- Time-series pattern extraction
- Forecasting and reasoning over sequential data
